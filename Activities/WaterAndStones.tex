\firstpageheader{Math 102}{\bf Water and Stones}{Thursday, September 13}


\begin{document}
\begin{questions}
  \question Bruce and Sam find themselves by a fountain (with plenty of water).  They have two big water bottles: one holds exactly 3 gallons, the other 5 gallons.  However, to prevent disaster, they must measure exactly 4 gallons of water (held in the 5-gallon bottle).  There are no markings on the bottles.  Can they do it in time???

  \clearpage

  \question Here is a two-player game you can play with 40 stones (or really any number of any small objects): players alternate, removing stones from the pile until no stones remain.  The player to take the last stone(s) is the winner.

  However, there are some restrictions.  The first player can take any number of stones, but not all of them.  After the first move, each player can take any number of stones up to twice the number the previous player took.  Every turn, at least one stone must be taken (you cannot ``pass'').

  Do you want to go first or second?  Is there a ``winning strategy''?
